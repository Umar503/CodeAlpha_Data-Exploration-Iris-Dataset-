 # Iris Dataset Exploration

This project explores the famous Iris dataset using Python and various data analysis libraries.

## Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It contains measurements of various features of iris flowers, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the corresponding species.

In this project, we perform the following tasks:

1. Load the Iris dataset and explore its structure.
2. Check for missing values and handle them if necessary.
3. Visualize the data using plots and graphs to understand the distribution of each feature.

## Getting Started

To run the code in this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine.
